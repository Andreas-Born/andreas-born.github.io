<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12429/full"><p style="font-weight:600;">An Experimental Investigation of Election Promises</p></a>


    <p style="padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:3px;margin-top:3px;font-size:13px;"><i>Political Psychology</i> 2017, with Pieter van Eck &amp; <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/person/?personid=1981033">Magnus Johannesson</a></p>

    <p class="reseach_text"><i>We analyze the effect of election promises on electoral behavior in a laboratory experiment.  In the experiment, politicians can make non-binding election promises about how to split an endowment between themselves and the group. We find that promises affect both voting and voter beliefs about how much the politician will contribute to the public fund. The relationship is inverted U-shaped with decreasing credibility of higher promises. Contributions of politicians are correlated with their promises in a similar pattern. The election promises are generally credible unless particularly high. Politicians keep promises more often if a re-election is possible, and if the politician came into power by vote rather than by random draw. Voters reward high contributions in the previous period and punish promise breaking even after controlling for the contribution in the previous period or voters’ beliefs about future contributions. By controlling for voters’ beliefs we distinguish retrospective from prospective voting. Our results suggest that voters both use promises for prospective voting, and retrospectively punish broken promises.</i></p>

            <p class="reseach_text"><i>Despite the significant growth in female labor force participation and educational attainment over the past decades, labor markets remain vertically and horizontally segregated.. In this paper, we explore whether male dominated environments, in and of themselves, have adverse effects on women. We employ a laboratory experiment with a total of 580 participants of both genders, randomly assigning participants to teams that are either female majority (three women and one man) or male majority (three men and one woman). In line with our primary hypothesis, we find that women are significantly more reluctant to become the team leader in male majority teams than in female majority teams. This effect is not driven by gender differences in ability to perform the assigned tasks.  Our exploratory analyses of potential mechanisms show that, compared to women in female majority teams, women in male majority teams believe that they perform worse relative to the other team members, are less influential, are more swayed by the team discussion, and (accurately) believe that they will receive less support from the other team members. This suggests that the absence of women in male dominated contexts may be a self-reinforcing process contributing to persistent gender segregation. </i></p>

 <p class="reseach_text"><i>           This paper takes advantage of the mixed member proportional system in the German parliament by employing a regression discontinuity design to quantify the causal effect of a district election on the conformity to the party line. First, we show that the election by a district does not affect the roll call voting behavior of a politician causally. Second, we use informational retrieval methods to analyze parliamentary speeches. We demonstrate that speeches of district elected members of parliament do not differ, in terms of cosines-distance, from those of their party-peers who have been elected through closed party lists. To build a measure of closeness of a speech to a party, we train a classifier on the party manifestos and use it to predict probabilities of a parliamentary speech belonging to a certain manifesto. We use the predicted probability of an MP's own party manifesto as a measure of closeness of the wording to the party's manifesto. We show that district elected candidates do not use a wording closer or further away from the party's manifesto. We can negate that district elected MPs have a faster within party career progression.
