<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12429/full"><p style="font-weight:600;">An Experimental Investigation of Election Promises</p></a>


    <p class="content_subtext"><i>Political Psychology</i> 2018, with Pieter van Eck &amp; <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/person/?personid=1981033">Magnus Johannesson</a></p>

    <p class="reseach_text"><i>We analyze the effect of election promises on electoral behavior in a laboratory experiment.  In the experiment, politicians can make non-binding election promises about how to split an endowment between themselves and the group. We find that promises affect both voting and voter beliefs about how much the politician will contribute to the public fund. The relationship is inverted U-shaped with decreasing credibility of higher promises. Contributions of politicians are correlated with their promises in a similar pattern. The election promises are generally credible unless particularly high. Politicians keep promises more often if a re-election is possible, and if the politician came into power by vote rather than by random draw. Voters reward high contributions in the previous period and punish promise breaking even after controlling for the contribution in the previous period or voters’ beliefs about future contributions. By controlling for voters’ beliefs we distinguish retrospective from prospective voting. Our results suggest that voters both use promises for prospective voting, and retrospectively punish broken promises.</i></p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">Promise Competition</p>


    <p class="content_subtext"><i>Work in progress</i></p>
<p class="reseach_text"><i> This paper studies competition when sellers cannot perfectly commit to their offers. Two sellers compete by promising service-quality to a one-time customer. Both have private information about the own cost of supplying quality and of breaking promises. In any equilibrium satisfying D1, sellers pool at a single promise. Pooling prevents positive selection of better sellers yet competition induces sellers to promise higher quality than they would otherwise provide. Therefore, competition raises average service-quality despite non-binding contracts and private information.
A laboratory experiment confirms these predictions. While participants distinguish themselves by their promises initially, they learn to pool their promises and selection of better seller-types becomes impossible over repetitions. I find evidence that promise competition increases buyer welfare, moreover an increase in promises is correlated with an increased quality-provision by sellers. </i></p>

</p></a>
    <p class="content_subtext"><i>working paper</i>,  with <a href="https://www.annasandberg.nu/">Anna Sandberg</a> &amp <a href="https://economics.handels.gu.se/om-institutionen/personal?userId=xranee">Eva Ranehill</a></p>

</p>
            <p class="reseach_text"><i>Despite the significant growth in female labor force participation and educational attainment over the past decades, labor markets remain vertically and horizontally segregated. In this study, we explore whether male dominated environments, in and of themselves, adversely affect women´s willingness to lead a team. We find that women randomly assigned to male majority teams are less willing to become team leaders than women assigned to female majority teams are. Analyses of potential mechanisms show that women in male majority teams are less confident in their relative performance, less influential and more swayed by others in the team discussions. They also (accurately) believe that they will receive less support from team members in the leadership election. Taken together, our results indicate that the absence of women in male dominated contexts may be a self-reinforcing process.  </i></p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">Do district elected MPs favor their district or their party? A textual analysis of parliamentary speeches using machine learning
</p>
    <p class="content_subtext"><i>Work in progress</i> with <a href="https://www.aljoschajanssen.com">Aljoscha Janssen</a></p>
<p class="content_subtext">
</p>

 <p class="reseach_text"><i>           This paper takes advantage of the mixed member proportional system in the German parliament by employing a regression discontinuity design to quantify the causal effect of a district election on the conformity to the party line. First, we show that the election by a district does not affect the roll call voting behavior of a politician causally. Second, we use informational retrieval methods to analyze parliamentary speeches. We demonstrate that speeches of district elected members of parliament do not differ, in terms of cosines-distance, from those of their party-peers who have been elected through closed party lists. To build a measure of closeness of a speech to a party, we train a classifier on the party manifestos and use it to predict probabilities of a parliamentary speech belonging to a certain manifesto. We use the predicted probability of an MP's own party manifesto as a measure of closeness of the wording to the party's manifesto. We show that district elected candidates do not use a wording closer or further away from the party's manifesto. We can negate that district elected MPs have a faster within party career progression.
